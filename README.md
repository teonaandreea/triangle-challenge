## Description ‚úèÔ∏è

The idea of the project is to create a program that can determine the type of a triangle, based on the lengths of its three sides. In addition to this, some extra information about the triangle will be calculated, such as the perimeter, semiperimeter and area. This is done by using JavaScript only. Instead of a "basic" form approach, where users just submit the form and get an answer, I chose to add event listeners to all the input fields in order to detect when the user is interacting with the form and check if the values entered are valid. This way, the users always get feedback following their actions and it is easier for them to change values, without having to resubmit the form in order to get an answer.

As for the design, the project is using Bootstrap, in order to provide some basic consistent styling for the most used components, such as inputs and buttons. Since it is a very small project that doesn't require much styling on top of the classes offered by Bootstrap, I have only created one sass file for all my styling, as using the "atomic design" pattern wouldn't make much sense in this case.
